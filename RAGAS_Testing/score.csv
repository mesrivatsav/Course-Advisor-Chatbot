Can you tell me the entry requirements of Bachelor of Business (Honours) in Accounting in MTU?,"Once upon a time, there was a young girl named Lily who had always been fascinated by the world of science and technology. She loved learning about new inventions and how they worked. One day, while browsing through her favorite science magazine, she came across an article about modern technology and its impact on society. The article discussed various aspects such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML).

Lily was intrigued by the concept of AI and ML and wanted to learn more about it. She decided to do some research and found out that AI refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines, while ML is a subset of AI that focuses on developing algorithms that can learn from data and improve their performance over time.

As she delved deeper into her research, Lily discovered that modern technology has revolutionized many industries such as healthcare, finance, and transportation. She learned about the different applications of AI and ML in these fields. For example, AI is used to develop self-driving cars, which use machine learning algorithms to learn from experiences and improve their performance over time.

Lily was amazed at how modern technology has advanced so much that it can be used for various purposes such as image recognition, speech recognition, and more. She learned about the different types of AI and ML applications in healthcare, finance, and transportation.

As she read about the application in healthcare, and more.
